                            have a credit or debit card that we accept (see bottom of page for details of current payment providers); and

                            We only accept your order once payment has been approved and we have debited the payment card (and then the contract is made based on these terms).
                            
                            You may be able to cancel (not change) your order within a short period of ordering – timings depend on your chosen delivery method (and will be set out in the acknowledgement email). You can’t change your order – you’ll need to cancel (and/or return original item(s)), and re-order.
                            
                            All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Don’t worry, if there’s an issue with an order, we’ll get in touch with you.
                            
                            Very occasionally, we may need to refuse or cancel an order or close or freeze an account (even if we have previously confirmed your order) – e.g. if we notice something unusual on an order or an account or if your order goes against unit limits as detailed on the product display pages of specific products. If this happens to you and you think we’ve made a mistake, please don’t take offence – get in touch with Customer Care and they’ll be happy to speak to you about it.</div>

If we discover an error for any goods you’ve ordered, we will tell you ASAP and give you the option of reconfirming your order (at the correct price) or cancelling it.

                            If we can’t get in touch with you, we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you’ve already paid, we will refund you in full.

                            We work our SchoolThings socks off to try to meet all delivery times but sometimes there may be delays – e.g. because of postal/carrier delays, logistics or bad weather. We will keep you updated as much as we can and you should be able to track your parcel’s progress.
                            
                            Please check out our Delivery and Returns Page for more info. Any problems with your delivery? Please let us know within 30 days of the date which your order should have been delivered and we’ll do our best to help you.

                                We get it, sometimes something just doesn’t work for you and you want your money back. Don’t worry, as long as an item is still in its original condition, we accept returns, subject to the rules below.
                                
                                Returns from Belgium, Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Portugal, New Zealand or Switzerland:
                                
                                If you return an item requesting a refund within 28 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you a full refund by way of the original payment method. 
                                
                                Returns from elsewhere:
                                
                                If you return an item requesting a refund within 28 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you a full refund by way of the original payment method.
                                
                                If you return an item requesting a refund within 29 and 45 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you an SchoolThings gift voucher for the amount equivalent to the price you paid for the item.
                                
                                For all returns, we aim to refund you within 14 days of having received the returned item into our warehouse.
                                If you request a refund for an item during the above time frames but you can't return it to us for some reason, please get in touch – but any refund will be at our discretion.
                                
                                After that?
                                
                                We don’t accept returns for unwanted items after the relevant returns period above. If you try to make a return, we may have to send it back to you and ask you to cover the delivery costs.
                                
                                What happens to my return if I ordered using a pay later solution?
                                
                                If you've placed an order with one of our pay later solutions, you’ll be paying for your order in regular instalments or within 14 days of it being placed. If you return an item within 28 days of it being delivered or available for collection, we'll give you a full refund.
                                
                                If you decide to return something within 29 to 45 days of it being delivered to you or available for collection, an SchoolThings gift voucher will be issued to you instead, and any Pay Later payments will still apply. SchoolThings has no liability to you for these payments or any additional charges incurred, so make sure to pay them off in full!</p>
